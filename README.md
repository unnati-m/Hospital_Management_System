# Hospital_Management_System

This project describes the network design of Health care management or
Hospital. In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, switches,
routers or other devices) are connected to a local area network (LAN)
and network via links (twisted pair copper wire cable or optical fibre
cable). We have used Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network
topology Itâ€™s a general design which can be implemented at any higher
level to manage network system.
